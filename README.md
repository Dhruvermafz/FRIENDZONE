# FRIENDZONE

## Introduction:zap:

Friendzone is a full stack aplication, where users can connect with others, share posts, and interact with content. EVERYONE COULD FRIENDZONE YOU BUT NOT US. The idea is to make a place where you can find new friends, so, the app does a match with someone based on a easy to do personality test, then you can talk with all the people that you had a match with.
